#write a small C library; it must contain the function sleepsafe(); - your implementation of a ‘safe and correct’ sleep() functionality (the sleep must not abort if ‘disturbed’ by signals). Create 
#a shared library (call it mylib.so) on Linux and place the function there; test by calling it from an app (you will need to research how to create a shared library on Linux)
